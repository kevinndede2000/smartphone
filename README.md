📱🐾 OOP Assignment: Devices & Animals
Welcome to a fun and interactive Python project that explores Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through two relatable domains: Smartphones and Animals. This assignment demonstrates key OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in a way that’s both practical and playful.

🔧 Part 1: Smartphone Class Demo
Students build a Smartphone class that inherits from a generic Device class. The phone tracks battery usage, charging behavior, and displays dynamic feedback.

✅ Concepts Covered:
Class inheritance (Smartphone → Device)

Encapsulation (__battery as a private attribute)

Method overriding (__str__)

Dynamic simulation with multiple objects

🧪 Sample Output:
Code
Testing: Samsung Galaxy S24 (Android, 256GB)
Samsung Galaxy S24
Samsung Galaxy S24 used for 2 hrs → Battery: 80%
Samsung Galaxy S24 used for 1 hrs → Battery: 70%
Samsung Galaxy S24 is charging... Battery: 85%
Samsung Galaxy S24 battery at 85%
----------------------------------------
🐾 Part 2: Polymorphism Demo
Students create an Animal base class and override the speak() method in various subclasses. Each animal expresses itself differently, showcasing polymorphism in action.

✅ Concepts Covered:
Method overriding

Polymorphism via shared interface (speak())

🧪 Sample Output:
Code
Dog says: Woof! Woof!
Cat says: Meooow!
Cow says: Moooo!
Parrot says: Hello there!
kochieng says: good morning my neighbors!
🚀 How to Run
Make sure Python is installed, then run the script from your terminal:

bash
python superhero.py
If you're using PowerShell, use python .\superhero.py or .\superhero.py depending on your setup.

🎓 Classroom Extension Ideas
Add a Tablet or Smartwatch subclass with unique features.

Simulate battery drain based on app types (e.g., gaming vs. texting).

Create a Zoo class that manages multiple animals.

Add interactive input for custom device creation.
